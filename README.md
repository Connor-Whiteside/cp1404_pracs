# CP1404 Repository - Connor Whiteside

## Repository Information

The following repository was made by Connor Whiteside an aspiring mathematician and data science at James Cook
University. This repository contains programs that have been made in CP1404, to show that the lessons have been
taught and learned from class. This repo is proof that with little steps even mountains can be crossed. The following
list contains a few points of the main lessons that I have learned about "clean code" throughout this subject.

- Iterative development is the key to success and solving hard problems
- Patterns page is your friend
- Keeping up with the lessons helps in the long run
